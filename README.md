# RPS_game_automation (Rock-Paper-Scissors game)
Trying  to defeat algorythms from freecodecamp  with win rate > 60% .... not yet getting to it
This is a project from freecodecamp.
I have to write code for the RPS.py file, so we can defeat with a win rate > 60% to the other players in RPS_game.py, such as abbey, mrugesh, kris and quincy.
It resulted hard to achieve that goal...

In y RPS.py, I have used Reinforcement Learning (trainin a 9x3 Q-table), and randomly use the kris player algorythm and and modified abbey strategy (using chain of last three plays, rather than just two).
